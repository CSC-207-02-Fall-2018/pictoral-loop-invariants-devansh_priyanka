We believe our programs are correct because we made sure to test each of the programs with different test cases
and looked at whether the answers were right or wrong.

For example, for all the other programs apart from the Dutch National Flag problem, we tested the programs
under several conditions:
1) when the array is already sorted
2) When the minimum number in the array is the first element in the array
3) When the minimum number in the array is the last element in the array
4) when there is only one number in the array
5) When the array is null
